# Projected Maps

Minimal example of how to project a map on a surface, using the projection-mapping javascript library [maptastic](https://github.com/glowbox/maptasticjs). 

- Loads a map (here we are using an iframe from [umap](https://umap.openstreetmap.fr/en/) from one of our projects).
- Allows to control the corners and adjust to the underlying surface (table, paper, etc).

It looks like this: ![image](image.png)
